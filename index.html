    <p>Hello! I am currently a Junior studying at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am originally from Bellevue, Washington. I am currently majoring in Psychology, along with certificates in Asian American studies, Gender and Women Studies, LGBTQ+ studies, as well as Digital Studies. I am super excited to showcase my first personal website! In this website, I hope to present aspects of my professional and extracurricular experiences, languages I speak natively, as well as some of my hobbies.</p>
